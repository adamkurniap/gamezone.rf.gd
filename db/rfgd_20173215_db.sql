Based off one of the most iconic horror franchises to ever exist, it&rsquo;s the ultimate game of hide and seek and had the potential to be one of the most fun games of 2017. The key word is <em>had</em>.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	Friday the 13th is probably the most broken game I&rsquo;ve played in the last few years. The game has massive server issues making it so you can&rsquo;t matchmake - which is an issue when the game only offers multiplayer. The only way to join a match is if you have friends or can wrangle together some random people via social media. If you have no friends who own the game or can&rsquo;t find anyone willing to play, too bad for you, you just spent $39.99 on a menu screen. I should state I played the game on Xbox One, but I&rsquo;ve heard of people who have had issues across all platforms. I would be more understanding of the server issues if the game was actually good, but it isn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong>A nightmare to play and not in a good way:</strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong><img alt="Review: Friday the 13th: The Game is one of the biggest disappointments of 2017" src="http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1217197/friday-13th-game-2.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;" /></strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	This violent game of hide and seek has some of the most game breaking bugs and glitches I&rsquo;ve ever seen. For those unaware, in this game, there&rsquo;s a group of campers at a summer camp and at the start of each match, one person is picked to be Jason (essentially a 1v7 game, 7 counselors and 1 Jason looking to kill them). Jason has to kill everyone before time runs out or before the campers can find a way to escape or call for help. When the game works, it can actually be very fun but it&rsquo;s rare that everything runs smoothly.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	When playing as Jason, I noticed someone swimming in the lake. Of course, if you&rsquo;re caught swimming in the Friday the 13th movies you&rsquo;re pretty much already dead. So I sunk myself into the water and swam at the unsuspecting camper like I was&nbsp;Jaws&nbsp;and as I went to snatch them up and turn the blue waters into a thick, crimson liquid&hellip; she turned invisible. The game glitched out and the camera went to some untextured part of the map and when I returned the camper was invisible. I couldn&rsquo;t kill her because there was nothing to grab onto. At the end of the match, a bunch of the people who had already died or escaped chewed me out because they thought I was just an idiot and was choosing not to kill her. After explaining what happened, they told me similar things had happened to them. Due to this glitch, I was forced to lose the match.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	Other glitches I have run into range from seeing a fellow camper get stuck inside a wall for the entire match, not being able to pull out my gun to shoot Jason after spawning in as the legendary Tommy Jarvis, and not being able to buy new upgrades for my character in the main menu because it tells me there was some sort of error with the in-game purchase. On top of all of this, the game crashes and disconnects players from matches very frequently causing matches to abruptly end, killing all of the tension and ruining any fun that you may have been having.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong>It&#39;s plagued with technical issues:</strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong><img alt="Review: Friday the 13th: The Game is one of the biggest disappointments of 2017" src="http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1217198/friday-13th-game-1.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;" /></strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	Friday the 13th also has some issues with facial animations. They look&hellip; really bizarre. Sometimes a character&rsquo;s face will get stuck with their mouth hanging wide open and their eyes will look like they&rsquo;re being held open by clothespins. I get that they&#39;re supposed to be scared out of their mind, but it looks so incredibly goofy. It&#39;s not even an &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s supposed to be cheesy and campy&rdquo; way, it just looks bad.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	Some other issues I ran into was a somewhat inconsistent framerate and frustrating stamina mechanic. I&rsquo;m not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but framerate didn&rsquo;t appear to be locked and dips were noticeable. When playing as a camper, the screen will darken significantly when you&rsquo;re running low on stamina. It removes portions of the HUD off your screen and makes the game look unappealing. I get why they did it, but sometimes the game doesn&rsquo;t revert the color back once you recharge your stamina. It just stays dark and ugly.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	Now that we&rsquo;re done ranting about the technical issues with the game, let&rsquo;s talk about the gameplay itself. On the camper side of things, the game can be a bit frustrating. You lose stamina when you&rsquo;re just jogging, not even just when you&#39;re fully sprinting, making it so you end up walking at the speed of a snail, which is frustrating enough, but not the most frustrating thing. Hiding from Jason, the purpose of the game as a camp counselor, doesn&rsquo;t do a whole lot for you because he has a special ability that allows him to see which buildings have people inside them, so even if you hide under a bed or in a closet he&rsquo;ll probably find you.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong>It can be a lot of fun when it works:</strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong><img alt="Review: Friday the 13th: The Game is one of the biggest disappointments of 2017" src="http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1217199/friday-13th-game-4.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 345px;" /></strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	When you work with campers to find the parts to repair a car or boat, things can be really fun. You desperately scavenge for gas, car keys, and other materials all while Jason lurks in the woods with the classic Friday the 13th music and sound effects playing in the background. It creates a lot of tension and can cause moments of terror when you&rsquo;re trying to start the car by wiggling the key in the ignition all while he slowly walks towards you and your fellow camp counselors. You&rsquo;ll probably have moments where other players are screaming into their microphones as you all panic and grip your controller tight and that&rsquo;s when Friday the 13th is at its best.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	When playing as Jason, things can be both bad and good. It&rsquo;s really fun to brutally execute people and to hunt unsuspecting people down but it can also be a bit tedious. Sometimes I found myself chasing people for several minutes and never being able to lay a hand on them and it made things really anti-climactic. No matter what I did, they&rsquo;d just be able to keep on running which made me scratch my head in confusion because whenever I even jogged my stamina would drain rapidly and I&rsquo;d barely be able to move.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	One of my biggest concerns for this game was that Jason would be really overpowered. He has several special abilities that could be considered cheap but they&rsquo;re all unlocked at different points in the match as to not make it really unfair. He has four special abilities but at the start of each match, only one or two are made available. As time stretches on, other abilities will unlock allowing him to be able to hopefully kill the remaining campers. It helps not only keep things balanced but also help players who may not be particularly good at playing the iconic killer.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong>Verdict:</strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	<strong><img alt="Review: Friday the 13th: The Game is one of the biggest disappointments of 2017" src="http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1217200/friday-13th-game-5.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 349px;" /></strong></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">\r\n	Despite how fun it can be, Friday the 13th: The Game has an overwhelming amount of issues both with and without glitches and bugs. It&rsquo;s clear the game wasn&rsquo;t ready to be released and should&rsquo;ve been delayed so that some of the kinks could be worked out. The lack of a single player mode at launch is also very annoying due to the fact that the online portion of the game barely works. If you were planning on getting Friday the 13th, you should probably wait until the single player mode is added and until they can make the game at least somewhat playable.</p>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n      <div class="bottom-badge" itemprop="rating" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Rating">\r\n        <div class="rating-120 r-50"><meta content="5.0" itemprop="rating"></meta><meta content="10" itemprop="best"></meta></div>\r\n          <div class="recap">\r\n            <p class="title">Bottom Line</p>\r\n            <p>Despite being a fun game at its core (even with some issues presented in gameplay), a number of bugs and glitches in Friday the 13th: The Game make it hard to enjoy.</p>\r\n          </div>', '980ccd97eff2c15896ed4da28ae2e7c1.jpg', '2017-06-01 15:06:37', 'web', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'web'),

Publisher Ubisoft threw a surprise wrench in the works when they released Far Cry: Primal however, as the prehistoric spin-off game came out in February 2016, killing any hopes for the main series&rsquo; fifth game coming out in the same year.</p>\r\n<p>That meant most fans expect Far Cry 5 to arrive some time in 2017. We do at least know for sure that the game is in the works, as Ubisoft confirmed its existence in an earnings call with investors, revealing that it is one of four games due out before March 2018, alongside <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/assassins-creed-origins-rumours-release-date-setting-screenshots-3651475/" target="_blank">Assassin''s Creed: Origins</a>, <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/south-park-fractured-but-whole-uk-release-date-preorder-gameplay-trailer-3642078/" target="_blank">South Park: The Fractured But Whole</a>, and <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/crew-2-rumours-release-date-gameplay-platforms-3659235/">The Crew 2</a>.\r\n<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async=""></script>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>However, our dreams of a 2017 release were crushed by&nbsp;the Far Cry 5 reveal trailer which states that Far Cry 5 is set to&nbsp;be released on&nbsp;<strong>27 February 2018.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>But why so late? In&nbsp;September 2016,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/09/28/ubisoft-wont-necessarily-release-assassins-creed-or-far-cry-games-in-2017" target="_blank">IGN</a> spoke to Ubisoft VP of editorial Tommy Fran&ccedil;ois, who revealed why&nbsp;Far Cry could (and has) slip back to 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>"I''ll tell you what, we believe Alpha for these games needs to be one year before release. We''re trying to achieve that. That''s super f****** blunt, I don''t even know if I''m allowed to say this. This is the goal we''re going for: Alpha one year before, more quality, more polish. So if this means biting the [bullet] and not having an Assassin''s game, or a Far Cry [in 2017], f*** it."</p>\r\n<p><img data-original-width="1920" data-original-height="1080" class="lz lightbox" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3651558/far_cry_5_2_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><noscript><img data-original-width="1920" data-original-height="1080" class="lightbox lz" src="https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3651558/far_cry_5_2_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></noscript></p>\r\n<p>Some might worry that it&rsquo;s a bad sign for the franchise&rsquo;s future or reflects unhappiness about recent sales, but Fran&ccedil;ois dismissed those concerns quickly, and emphasised that the extra development time is based on creative concerns, to try and make Far Cry 5 the best game that it can be.</p>\r\n<p>"No, Far Cry''s only been going up in sales, so that''s not true [...] We sometimes try to do too much - I''m actually super-happy. I know it''s perceived like [a marketing decision], and even if it is [perceived that way], it''s actually OK. People are allowed to perceive it like that, that it''s a break in the brand and that we''re doing it for that. I have no quarrels. I just want people to fall in love when people try the next iteration of one of these two brands."</p>\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to wait and missed it the first time around, you can pick up Far Cry: Primal for just &pound;18 on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2htCclh" target="_blank">Amazon</a>&nbsp;at the moment, which can hopefully tide you over until we get more concrete news on Far Cry 5.</p>\r\n<h2>What platforms will it be on?</h2>\r\n<p>Following the official Far Cry 5 announcement trailer, we now know that the game will be available for PS4, Xbox One and PC, with Sony''s PlayStation having some kind of exclusivity, although details of the partnership are yet to be announced. It&rsquo;s very likely it will have support for the more advanced features of the <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/review/games-consoles/ps4-pro-review-playstation-4-pro-review-3649359/" target="_blank">PS4 Pro</a>&nbsp;and maybe even <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/xbox-one-scorpio-rumours-project-scorpio-release-date-rumours-project-scorpio-feature-pricing-rumours-3647506/" target="_blank">Xbox One Scorpio</a>&nbsp;too.</p>\r\n<p>The only other major potential platform is the <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new-product/game/nintendo-switch-price-release-date-specs-games-3608381/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. Ubisoft has already confirmed that it is developing a &ldquo;wide variety&rdquo; of games for the Switch, but it seems as if&nbsp;Far Cry 5 won''t be headed to the Switch, even with&nbsp;lower graphical power.</p>\r\n<p><img data-original-width="1920" data-original-height="1080" class="lz lightbox" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3651558/far_cry_5_1_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><noscript><img data-original-width="1920" data-original-height="1080" class="lightbox lz" src="https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3651558/far_cry_5_1_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></noscript></p>\r\n<h2>What about the setting and gameplay?</h2>\r\n<p>The most recent Far Cry games have become best known for leading the way in terms of open-world first-person shooters. Far Cry 3 allowed players to explore a pair of enormous tropical islands, while Far Cry 4 offered the whole of the Himalayas to explore, so it&rsquo;s likely that Far Cry 5 will offer a similarly expansive environment.</p>\r\n<p>That environment is closer to home for some than previous games, as the game takes place in modern-day Montana in the northwest United States. As a member of law enforcement in the fictional Hope County, you&rsquo;ll come face-to-face with crazy cultists and dedicated militias in true, chaotic Far Cry fashion.</p>\r\n<p>In a change to previous Far Cry games, Far Cry 5 will allow you to customise the look of the main character. Beyond being a junior deputy sheriff, the protagonist is a blank canvas. Some are speculating that the choices you make in terms of race (and possibly gender) could influence the way the story is told, and how others interact with you, although only time will tell. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Far Cry 5 pits you against Joseph, the bearded figure that posed like Jesus in the teaser image released by Ubisoft prior to the reveal. Joseph is the leader of a doomsday cult called &lsquo;Project at Eden&rsquo;s Gate&rsquo; and has swathes of underlings to help him carry out his work, along with other cult leaders (who all happen to be members of his family).</p>\r\n<p><img class="lz" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3651558/far-cry-5-teaser.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><noscript><img class="" src="https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3651558/far-cry-5-teaser.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></noscript></p>\r\n<p>However, while you&rsquo;ll go up against cultists in a big way, you&rsquo;ll also have the aid of many Hope County locals. Three of your key allies in Far Cry 5 are Pastor Jerome Jeffries, a clergyman armed to the teeth and ready to fight for what&rsquo;s right, along with Mary May, a tavern owner who knows a thing or two about Molotov cocktails, and Nick Rye, a pilot that attached a gatling gun to his plane.</p>\r\n<p>Looking beyond the setting and its qwerky inhabitants, it is likely that players can expect Far Cry 5 to have less focus on a linear narrative and instead bring the open world elements even further to the fore. Ubisoft chief creative officer Serge Hascoet told&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/11/15/dans-les-prochains-jeux-video-ubisoft-il-y-aura-de-moins-en-moins-de-narration_5031610_4408996.html">Le Monde</a>&nbsp;that his focus was on making &ldquo;worlds that are interesting to me, even as a tourist,&rdquo; where &ldquo;my actions will change the world."</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the player to go through a story created by someone. We have games like that still, but I ask more and more that we let the player write their own story &mdash; that they set themselves a long-term goal, identify the opportunities that are open to them and choose not to follow a path that was decided for them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The company has also confirmed that Far Cry 5 will be co-op from beginning to end, allowing groups of friends to explore the open world of Hope County.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll be sure to update this article as soon as we have any more details about Far Cry 5, so check back in the future.</p>', 'farcry51.jpg', '2017-06-01 14:53:02', 'web', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'web'),

(18, 1, 'Persona 5 Might Be the Best RPG Ever Made', '<div class="entry-content">\r\n    			<p>Balancing your time between studying for midterms, having a social life, and feeding your personal plant has never been this fun.</p>\r\n<p>The high school/monster-fighting life-simulator that is <em>Persona</em> is finally back, and it&#8217;s as wonderfully stylish and charming as you&#8217;d expect it to be&#8211;along with the usual robust turn-based RPG elements. In <a href="http://nerdist.com/tag/persona-5/"><em>Persona 5</em></a> a new cast of kids band together as a team of thieves who stage heists in the shadow monster-ridden alternate dimension referred to as the Metaverse. The refreshing batch of brand new faces, gripping story, and excellent (and for the most part, familiar) <em>Persona</em> gameplay hooks, makes this a stylish must play title for all PS4 owners.</p>\r\n<p><em>Persona 5</em> doesn&#8217;t take very long to throw you into the midst of a mystery. The story picks up with the main character conducting a heist at what appears to be a casino. Without any knowledge of what&#8217;s actually going on, a number of prompts appear on screen to explain the basics (like how to hide in the shadows and jump from platforms) all while an unknown voice, which refers to you as Joker, relays instructions to help you make your grand escape. Soon, you find yourself ambushed and in an interrogation room, rattled and beaten. What&#8217;s going on? Who knows! All you&#8217;re told is that one of your friends sold you out. And thus, the mystery begins.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-494473" src="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Heist-615x346.jpeg" alt="Persona 5 Heist" srcset="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Heist-615x346.jpeg 615w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Heist-768x432.jpeg 768w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Heist-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Heist-680x383.jpeg 680w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Heist-970x545.jpeg 970w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>\r\n<p>From here on out, most of this game is told through a series of flashbacks starting at the point where our protagonist (the guy being interrogated) arrives at his new home in Yongen-Jaya. Over the course of the first couple of hours, his backstory is revealed. In short, he was displaced from his previous home after being sued for attacking a man who was in the middle of assaulting a young woman. His punishment? Probation and having to attend the volleyball-dominated Shujin Academy in the heart of the city.</p>\r\n<p>Like previous titles in the series, the game breaks down into two different sections: a dungeon crawler in which you&#8217;ll be exploring massive dungeons, level grinding, and fighting bosses; and a teenage life simulator. Of course, that&#8217;s putting it in simple terms. The cool thing about <em>Persona 5</em> is that those two seemingly different aspects of the game are brilliantly intertwined and bursting at the seams with content and interesting things to do.</p>\r\n<p>When you&#8217;re living out your normal teenage life, you&#8217;ll be answering quiz questions in class, choosing which friends to hang out with, and even eating burgers. While that may sound mundane, making good use of your time is important because it allows you to increase social statistics like guts, kindness, and knowledge, which in turn have important implications throughout your journey. Choosing which friends to increase your bonds with, for instance, will become important during battles and persona execution/fusions, since certain bonds will give new personas additional experience points.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-494466" src="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-School-615x346.jpg" alt="Persona 5 School" srcset="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-School-615x346.jpg 615w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-School-768x432.jpg 768w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-School-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-School-680x383.jpg 680w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-School-970x545.jpg 970w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-School.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>\r\n<p>Running around town and accomplishing these small tasks always feels rewarding and makes for a great change of pace after level-grinding in dungeons. Between starting a part-time job in the game and preparing for upcoming midterms, I found myself busy at all times without a shred of boredom. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve spent as much time at the library in real life as I have in this game. Prioritizing how you spend these days is key, especially because there is always a deadline looming around the corner.</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully, the friends and allies you share the journey with leave a lasting impression, and add a bold and believable splash of color to each day. For the core group, you&#8217;ve got Morgana, the brains of the operation and a cute little kitty who doesn&#8217;t like to be reminded it&#8217;s a cat. Then there&#8217;s Ryuji and Ann, the other two founding members of your thieves group, who bear striking resemblances to <em>Persona 4</em> favorites like Kanji and Yosuke (whom Ryuji is a combo between), and Rise and Yukiko (ditto for Ann).</p>\r\n<p>Of course, comparing them to the old cast is unfair, because there&#8217;s more than meets the eye to these fictional folk. As your bonds develop with these confidants, so too does your knowledge of their lives, personalties, and personal baggage. The nice thing is that over time, they evolve from familiar anime archetypes to realistic friends you care for and won&#8217;t want to leave once the 100+ hour saga is over.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-494475" src="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-team-615x346.jpeg" alt="Persona 5 team" srcset="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-team-615x346.jpeg 615w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-team-768x432.jpeg 768w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-team-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-team-680x383.jpeg 680w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-team-970x545.jpeg 970w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>\r\n<p>The other half of this game is more of your standard RPG: go into the shadow world to explore massive dungeons, beat down on monsters, and battle giant bosses. But there&#8217;s a nice little twist in the latest and greatest. Remember I mentioned a team of thieves? Well, you and your friends are trying to change the heart of those with shady intentions through the alternate dimension. The desires of those who are extra awful materialize as a palace (a.k.a. dungeons) in the shadow world. You must infiltrate and find their desires within the maze.</p>\r\n<p>Along the way you&#8217;ll find safe rooms, maps, and chests that make it feel like an actual heist operation. Unlike the procedurally generated dungeons of the series&#8217; past, <em>Persona 5</em> opts for a variety of intricate, fully fleshed out dungeons packed with enemies, puzzles and light platforming. Each of these &#8220;palaces&#8221; boasts a unique theme different from the next. I don&#8217;t want to dive into any spoilers here, just know that the new format makes the dungeons fun to explore and some of the best in the franchise&#8217;s history.</p>\r\n<p>But the combat fun isn&#8217;t restricted to the palaces. <em>P5</em> also serves up a series of side-quests in the subway station called Mementos. Instead of focusing on the desires of one person, the area is a culmination of public injustices in the city. Once the missions open up, you&#8217;ll be able to explore the area, and take on new quests from people in the game.  It&#8217;s a great place to grind if you&#8217;re in a bind.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-494459" src="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Hold-UP-615x346.jpg" alt="Persona 5 Hold UP" srcset="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Hold-UP-615x346.jpg 615w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Hold-UP-768x432.jpg 768w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Hold-UP-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Hold-UP-680x383.jpg 680w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Hold-UP-970x545.jpg 970w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Hold-UP.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>\r\n<p>As for the bread and butter of the game, the combat is basically as good as it has ever been, if not better. It&#8217;s the standard turn-based mechanics where each member of the crew takes turns to throw their dukes up. On your turn you can either shoot your gun, use a standard melee attack, consume an item, analyze you&#8217;re opponent, use your persona, or run. Of course there&#8217;s the rock-paper-scissors mechanic where each element is strong against a particular enemy and vice versa. For those new to the series, a persona in the Metaverse is supposed to be the shadow representation of each character. Our main protagonist, however, can wield several of them at a time, allowing him to adapt to whatever the situation calls for. This translates into different attacks and elemental strengths and weaknesses in battle. As you can only switch once in battle, choosing your personas adds yet another strategic element.</p>\r\n<p>Hitting an enemy will sometimes give you an extra turn, so you can start to juggle attacks if you strike their weakness. It gets even more insane with the new baton pass move&#8211;when you get the plus one attack, you can switch to another character who may be more adept at facing the other enemies. It&#8217;s a refreshing addition that keeps the cooperative synergy going.</p>\r\n<p>When you have weakened the opponent, you can gang up on them with the hold-up mechanic. This is when things get interesting. While in hold-up, you can either perform an all out attack to do a massive amount of damage with your squad, or negotiate with the creature to add it to your arsenal, win some cash, or get an item from them. While grinding for XP, the all-out mode was often the quickest route to pushing forward. But if it was a new persona, it was rewarding to engage in the quirky conversation to unmask their true identity. The combination of the juggling and persona elements make this a fresh turn-based approach, and a nice substitute for the Shuffle Mode of the series&#8217; past.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/BlushingPoorArcticseal" width="615" height="346" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>This game would be more than good enough with all of the gameplay hooks and engaging RPG elements, but I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention how absurdly stylish this game is. Most <em>Persona</em> games are pretty flashy, but this is the Odd Future of video games. There&#8217;s an emphasis on making it look like a hip anime, and keeping things like the transitions entering and leaving battle fluid at all times. It&#8217;s unabashedly unique in everything it does. This also seeps into the design of dungeons you&#8217;re exploring, whether it&#8217;s a massive castle or a lavish museum. This is a visually pleasing title. Same goes for the catchy tunes that you&#8217;ll gladly be humming all day.</p>\r\n<p>I do want to mention that there are some really dark themes explored in the game including abuse, sexual assault, and suicide, to name a few, so be prepared for some heavy tones in the midst of a generally upbeat experience. Previous games in the series have been rated M before, but this one takes it to a whole new level.</p>\r\n<p>There&#8217;s really only one gripe I have with <em>Persona 5</em>: it takes about 10 hours before the game really opens up. The first chunk of the game is all about teaching you the basics, from roaming around the real world to exploring the dungeons in the shadow world. It&#8217;s quite off-putting, really. For RPG aficionado, this is quite standard, but not everyone wants to have their hand held for such a large chunk of time. But I implore you to charge past the first dungeon, because what&#8217;s waiting for you after that is well worth the investment.</p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-494467" src="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Squad-615x346.jpg" alt="Persona 5 Squad" srcset="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Squad-615x346.jpg 615w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Squad-768x432.jpg 768w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Squad-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Squad-680x383.jpg 680w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Squad-970x545.jpg 970w, http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Persona-5-Squad.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>\r\n<h1>The Verdict</h1>\r\n<p><em>Persona 5</em> is life-consuming. Once it has its hook in you, there&#8217;s no escaping. Not only is this one of the best RPGs of the past few years, there&#8217;s an argument to be made that it belongs amongst the greatest of all time. There&#8217;s so much content and quality here, and honestly, it&#8217;s just a total blast. I can&#8217;t wait for <em>Persona 5 Dancing All Night </em>(not an actual game that has been announced, but I would love it).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rating: 4.5 out of 5</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-472180" src="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4.5-burritos1-615x100.jpg" alt="4.5-burritos1" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Images:  ATLUS</em></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A real <em>Mass Effect </em>omni-tool would be a true lightsaber</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><p><iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/3653334524001/HkI5VGlxx_default/index.html?videoId=5386413756001" width="615" height="346" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen></iframe></p></p>\r\n    		</div>', 'p5.jpg', '2017-06-01 18:29:05', 'web', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'web');

It''s an incredible port from an amazing game franchise, so we''re bumping the review up to the top of TA in case anyone missed it the first time around! Anyway, here''s Shaun''s original review which we published almost exactly two years ago, on July 3rd 2014:</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><a href="/games/monster-hunter-freedom-unite-for-ios">\r\n	<img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://cdnicons.toucharcade.com/icons/744/769918_larger.png" class="alignright size-thumbnail" title="appicon" alt width="150" height="150"><noscript><img class="alignright size-thumbnail" title="appicon" src="http://cdnicons.toucharcade.com/icons/744/769918_larger.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></noscript>\r\n</a>Capcom''s iOS games present a truly insane roll of the dice. You''ve got terribly reimagined ports of classics like <em>Mega Man X</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=469343097&mt=8">$4.99</a>], wonderful ports of underappreciated games like <em>Ghost Trick</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=489113377&mt=8">Free</a>], ports that are maybe a bit too perfect like <em>Street Fighter II Collection</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=459660048&mt=8">$3.99</a>] or the dearly departed <em>Marvel Vs.

This time, however, they''ve really gone and done it. Just when you think they can''t make you doubt them any further, they go and totally redeem themselves with an absolutely fantastic iOS version of <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em> [<a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=744769918&mt=8">$14.99</a>].</p>\r\n<p><span id="more-154001"></span>Let''s start off this review with the bare facts. Yes, only the second paragraph and we''re already dealing with nudity. That''s how you know it''s a spicy one. <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em> was originally released in Japan in early 2008 on Sony''s PSP system. It was an expanded version of the second <em>Monster Hunter Freedom</em> game, which was itself an enhanced portable version of the Japan-only <em>Monster Hunter 2</em> for PlayStation 2. While the series had gone relatively unnoticed on the PS2, it steadily picked up popularity in its handheld installments. With the release of this game, the series exploded in popularity in Japan, selling over a million copies in the first week alone, and establishing the series as an icon of modern Japanese popular culture, a position it still enjoys to this day. Not bad for what amounts to an expansion pack.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu.jpg"><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu.jpg" alt="mhfu" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154009" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image"><noscript><img src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu.jpg" alt="mhfu" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154009" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image" /></noscript></a></p>\r\n<p>After this game, the series branched out, with one further installment in the <em>Freedom</em> series on PSP, which was never localized, and a few mainline sequels for Nintendo systems, two of which have seen English versions. Yet, for many fans, <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em> is the installment that holds a special place in their hearts, and that might explain why Capcom has selected it to be the first traditional <em>Monster Hunter</em> game on iOS. Best of all, they''ve enhanced the game in a few ways, most notably allowing English handheld gamers to play together online for the first time without any additional hardware, and carefully redesigned the interface for touchscreen play instead of just cramming eight virtual buttons on the screen and calling it a day. If you''re keeping track, that makes this an enhanced port of an expansion of an enhanced port of a PlayStation 2 game. If that doesn''t give you warm fuzzy Capcom nostalgia, I don''t know what else to say here.</p>\r\n<p>It''s no secret that, like fellow Japanese pop culture gaming icon <em>Dragon Quest</em>, <em>Monster Hunter</em> has had a tough and bitter battle winning over Western gamers. It''s a series whose tempo doesn''t quite fit the expectations you might have just from hearing the abstract concept. You hear ''<em>Monster Hunter</em>'' and you''re probably imagining epic battles between your well-equipped, armor-clad hero and terrifying, fire-breathing dragons and such. Well, those fights <em>are</em> in the game, but this game takes its hunting seriously, and there''s more to hunting than just drunkenly stumbling into an animal''s space and waving your weapon around at its nose until it dies. For every thrilling action-packed fight, there''s at least triple the amount of time spent preparing traps, planning escape routes, gathering supplies, and so on. Charging into things disorganized will earn you a swat on the nose, and as the monsters get bigger and more dangerous, those swats will take off appropriately large pieces of your face.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2.jpg"><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2.jpg" alt="mhfu2" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154010" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image"><noscript><img src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2.jpg" alt="mhfu2" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154010" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu2-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image" /></noscript></a></p>\r\n<p><em>Monster Hunter</em> is an action game that is often mistakenly thought of as an RPG, and while it does have RPG elements in its equipment and quest systems, the real progression for the player is in skill and knowledge, not higher levels and new abilities. Your equipment will get stronger as you play through, but almost all of the abilities you will ever have or need are yours to use from the start. It''s up to you to make the best of them, and part of that is learning how each monster you''ll come across behaves. It''s perhaps hard to adjust to when so many of today''s games are built around meeting the player in their comfort zone, but this stubborn refusal to settle is a big part of why <em>Monster Hunter</em> is ultimately such a satisfying experience. There are a number of things about the game that will certainly chafe you until you get used to them, and the game will force you to do so whether you like it or not.</p>\r\n<p>This is never more apparent than in the early part of the game, where you will have to complete a couple of hours worth of training missions, many of which involve very little hunting of monsters at all. You''ll be sent out to gather certain herbs, or carry an egg from a nest back to your camp, and when you finally are sent to kill something, it''s a relatively non-hostile creature that will barely fight back. You will probably be ready to throw your paintbrush and paint bucket on the ground and tell the teacher off for wasting your time when you just want to learn how to fight. The final beginner training mission sends you after something a little bit more dangerous, however, and it may dawn on you during that mission what the purpose of all that figurative fence-painting really was. Walking up and poking the monster with your weapon of choice is only a small part of winning in <em>Monster Hunter</em>, while knowing the environment and how to take advantage of what it offers are huge aspects, and by the time you finish the training missions, they''ll be second nature to you.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3.jpg"><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3.jpg" alt="mhfu3" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154011" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image"><noscript><img src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3.jpg" alt="mhfu3" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154011" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu3-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image" /></noscript></a></p>\r\n<p>The basic structure of the game never really changes much. The town of Pokke serves as a hub where you can take on missions, tend to your farm, and upgrade, buy, or craft items and equipment. You can access your item box, save your game, or just chill out by talking to the townspeople. When you''re ready to head out, you can take a mission from a variety of sources. The missions are ranked according to difficulty and completing them will earn you cash, items, and guild points that go towards increasing your Hunter Rank. As your Hunter Rank rises, you''ll have access to more difficult missions with greater rewards. Increasing your Hunter Rank is one of the main goals of the game.</p>\r\n<p>After taking on a mission and departing Pokke town, you''ll travel to whichever destination the mission takes place in automatically. These places are large maps made up of several smaller interconnected areas, and cover a variety of terrain types such as snowy mountains, volcanoes, deserts, and jungles. You''ll start off in your camp area where you can access your bed and a couple of special item boxes. Each mission has a time limit, and you need to accomplish your goal before it runs out. If you happen to run out of health during a mission, the cute little Felyne characters will drag you back to your camp. You''ll incur a time and reward penalty, but you''re free to try again if you have enough time left. Once your goal is met, you''ll be given your reward and transported back to the town.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4.jpg"><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4.jpg" alt="mhfu4" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154012" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image"><noscript><img src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4.jpg" alt="mhfu4" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154012" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu4-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image" /></noscript></a></p>\r\n<p>You can choose between 11 different types of weapons, each with their specific strengths and weaknesses. You will need to play very differently depending on the one you choose, but there''s no penalty or loss for changing weapon types, so feel free to keep a variety on hand to suit the needs of each mission. You can''t change your gear while you''re in a mission, though, so it''s good to have a fallback weapon that suits your personal playstyle for cases when you''re not sure what will be best. Some of the weapons allow you to run, block, roll, or use items when they''re unsheathed, while others restrict you heavily at the cost of power. No one weapon has it all, so you''re always going to have to work around drawbacks, no matter what you bring. If only you could somehow have four different weapons to work with, some of those bigger monsters might go down more easily.</p>\r\n<p>The game''s format is wonderfully suited to handheld play, since many of the missions are relatively short, giving you a convenient stopping point if you need to put the game away and do something else. At the same time, improving your equipment, increasing your Hunter Rank, and improving the town offer great over-arching goals that keep you coming back. There are tons of missions and a lot of things to do in the single-player mode. I haven''t even mentioned fishing, bug-catching, mining, cooking lunch, combining items, running your Felyne kitchen, playing with a pig, training your assistant, and so on. It''s basically <em>Animal Crossing</em> with gobs of violence and skinning your neighbors so you can wear their faces as hats. You could easily spend dozens of hours playing the game on your own, and you probably will. The funny thing is, it''s actually just the warm-up for the real show.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1.jpg"><img src="http://toucharcade.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1.jpg" alt="mhfu1" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154013" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image"><noscript><img src="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1.jpg" alt="mhfu1" width="1136" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154013" srcset="http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1.jpg 1136w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mhfu1-624x351.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px full-width-image" /></noscript></a></p>\r\n<p>Sooner or later, you''re going to run into monsters that test your skill a little bit too much. As I mentioned, no one weapon does it all, but if you could bring in a few, you can probably cover most weaknesses. Well, for the first time in English on a handheld system, it''s very easy to play online multiplayer in the iOS version of <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em>. All you need is a WiFi connection, no extra console required. Up to four players can join together to take on a variety of missions with some truly amazing spoils. Like everything else in the game, playing effectively as a team takes a careful, planned approach. You can hit each other if you''re not careful, and most groups of hunters are only a few bad swings away from things going completely bananas, especially against some of the more powerful monsters. If you work well together, however, the rewards are great, both in terms of items and personal satisfaction. This is where the series shines brightest, and it works perfectly in this version.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest thing I was skeptical about with this version was the control system. Sure, the game supports MFi controllers, and it obviously plays as well as it did on PSP with one, if not better thanks to the camera being mapped to the right stick, avoiding the player having to use the "Claw" grip. Most people aren''t rocking controllers, though, and those that do have them don''t always bring them when they''re out and about. So, in the interest of science, while preparing for this review, I played the game primarily in touch mode, and I''m happy to report that it works better than I would have imagined. Things are streamlined in a way that there''s never an excessive amount of virtual buttons on the screen at any given point in time. Contextual actions only have their buttons come up when needed, and certain things assigned to extra buttons have been intelligently collapsed into the existing layout. The camera is a bit more fussy to deal with here than it is on a controller, but it''s partially made up for by allowing you to quickly snap the camera just by touching the screen. On the other hand, using items is easier with the touch layout. The directional stick takes a little getting used to, but if you''ve been gaming on iOS devices, you''ll be fine.</p>\r\n<p><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="560" height="343" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0JoCStLsRq8" frameborder="0"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;">\r\n<a HEREYES href="https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\r\n</div>\r\n		</p>\r\n<p>That sets the pace for the port overall. It''s absolutely fantastic. The bump in resolution has had no effect on the framerate, so everything looks great and runs smoothly, even against big chunky monsters. The excellent music and awesome sound effects are all here, and, like other English versions of the series, the translation is top-notch, with lots of funny text and no glaring problems with readability. Like reading this review, getting completely into <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em> requires patience, but once you understand the game, it''s basically a bottomless pit of enjoyment, as the massive thread <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=228108">in our forum</a> will attest to. You could spend literal hundreds of hours playing through all of the content it has to offer. This is a flawless version of an incredible game, and my animal-faced hat is off to the people at Capcom for putting this together.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n			</div>', 'mhfu.jpg', '2017-06-01 18:37:00', 'web', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'web');
